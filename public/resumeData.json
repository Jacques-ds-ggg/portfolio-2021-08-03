    "bio": "Hello! The Name is Jacques! I've been working with computers and code for over 5 years now. I am a aspiring freelance software developer student working on projects in all kinds of career paths to add to my portfolio for potential employers to see. I have been working loads of python programming projects covering intermediate programming techniques such as object oriented programming and data structures and algorithms. I'm always curious when it come to implementing new platforms in businesses and the collaboration of multiple business platforms to achieve a certain objective. I have also worked with some platforms such as - Snowflake - DataRobot - TigerGraph - Knime Data Analytics. I focus to skill up on industry trend IT platforms and techniques to stay up to date when approaching a project and challenge's faced by large companies.",
